        <h2>Sources for IP Addresses</h2>
        <p>IP addresses are managed and distributed by several organizations and entities. Hereâ€™s where you can get or find IP addresses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Internet Service Providers (ISPs):</strong> ISPs assign IP addresses to their customers when they connect to the internet. They manage a range of IP addresses and ensure they are allocated appropriately.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Administrators:</strong> In a corporate or organizational setting, network administrators assign IP addresses to devices within their network. They use internal IP address ranges to manage devices and ensure network stability.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Address Lookup Tools:</strong> Various online tools and services allow you to look up or check your IP address. These tools can display your public IP address and provide additional information about its location and ISP.</li>
            <li><strong>Regional Internet Registries (RIRs):</strong> Organizations such as ARIN, RIPE NCC, APNIC, LACNIC, and AFRINIC manage the allocation of IP addresses on a regional basis. They oversee the distribution of IP address blocks to ISPs and large organizations.</li>
            <li><strong>Public IP Address Providers:</strong> Some websites and services offer public IP addresses for specific uses, such as VPN services, proxy servers, and cloud hosting providers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information on how to obtain IP addresses or manage them, refer to the documentation provided by your ISP or network administrator.</p>
